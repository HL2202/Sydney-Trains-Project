# Sydney-Trains-Project
In light of the Covid-19 impacts on everyday life, I designed my Sydney Trains Project in June 2020 with the aim of helping people taking public transport on a regular basis. The primary service is the visual display of train delays across Sydney stations in real-time. The output includes transit location analysis, which is an analysis of network performance and train delays. Transit location analysis involves the geographical analysis of the network with a distribution display of the stations locations. The program operates through using real-time track updates (from Google Transits API) by reading constant input into the databases. The input data is displayed on a Google Map of Sydney, along with Google charts API, and is updated live. The platforms on the Google map are displayed in red for trains running late, and the trains running on-time are presented as green. I have designed this project with the intentions of creating meaningful contributions to helping my local community, and my city, to adapt in times of uncertainty by improving the safety and reducing the travel delays for commuters across Sydney.
